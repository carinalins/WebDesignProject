 			<b><h1><center>HEALTH INSURANCE</h1></b></center>

 			<p><b>It is a requirement of their Study Visa for non-EU students to take out private health insurance. For non-EU students who do not have current Health Insurance arrangements in place, ICOT will arrange student medical cover with O’Driscoll O’Neil. These policies cover emergency medical expenses, emergency travel and repatriation expenses and are compliant with the applicable visa regulations.</p></b>

 			<b><h1><center>LEARNER PROTECTION</h1></b></center>

			<p>In 2015, ICOT College announced one more measure that will assure protection for the current and future students: Learner Protection.

			With this implementation, the student who hires a course with ICOT College will be under the support of insurance, which will come into effect immediately if the contracted services can not be provided by the institution.

			For educational purposes, Learner Protection includes a policy and contract that ensures reimbursement to the student if the school can not offer the course in which he/she is enrolled. Insurance is available now and can be purchased by students doing short and long term courses.

			In addition to Learner Protection, ICOT College is a member of the Private College Network (PCN) – an organization of private schools that have a common interest in promoting English language teaching in Ireland and abroad and improving education standards and respect within this branch.</p>
